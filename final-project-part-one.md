# Outline
 
Initially the goal of the project was to highlight the breadth of what mathematics can be used for by looking at census data on jobs held by people who have gotten math degrees. While the premise that math is useful in just about everything is true, the data was not substantially supportive of this since most of the degrees I looked at had a similar breadth of jobs associated with their graduates. As a result, the new project idea I have is to highlight how the specific degrees don't matter in the modern day job market as much as one might expect. The story is that there are some very specialized degrees if you know where you want to end up, but for the most part degrees don't lock you into a specific type of job.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 



## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
