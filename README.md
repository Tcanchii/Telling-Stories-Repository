# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! 

# About me
I'm Thomas, a student at CMU, that enjoys things like mathematics, formal logic, and lifting weights. Currently I have been enjoying climbing at a climbing gym. 

# What I hope to learn
- More indepth color theory
- General design theory
- How to make data easier to parse

After graduating I will be working in AI development so my hope with this class is to be able to make more user friendly designs.
