# The final data story
[The final story can be found here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/does-your-university-degree-pigeonhole-you/index.html)

## Changes made since Part II
Some of the major feedback I wanted to focus on were colors, transitions/presentations of the content, and integrating the call to action throughout the presentation. 

# Colors
For the colors, I aimed to adjust them to something that continued to highlight the data I wanted while being a little easier on the eyes. I started with this:
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15299778"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

and went through multiple of the flourish color pallets and experimented with a few of my own. All the ones I tried either looked worse to look at but highligted the data, or looked better but did not give the impression I was looking for where it should subtly highlight the largest share of the graph. As an example, this color pallet looks nicer but "muddies" how much larger Education & Health is compared to the rest of the graph:
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15337053"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Perhaps being slightly red-green colorblind pushes green to be a more "alert" color for me, but the initial green I used felt like a very effective color for making the large category "pop" while not being as obvious/obnoxious as a harsher red. Ultimately, I stuck with the initial color scheme since it was doing everything I aimed for.

# Transitions and Presentation
I was not fully satisfied with the presentation of the data. The graphs were large and I felt as though I needed to walk an audience more through the analysis.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
