# OECD Data 1995-2021 
In this graphic we restrict focus on only the nations with an above OECD-average and visually represent the size of the debt using size and color. The reasoning behind this is that following the line graph above can be difficult so this should help with intuiting the scale. We use a smaller dataset to avoid being too messy and illegible.
