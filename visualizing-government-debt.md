# Visualizing Government Debt

# OECD Data 2021
In this graphic we will look at government of select nations' debt as a percent of GDP.

# OECD Data 1995-2021
In this graphic we will examine the historical part of the same data.

# OECD Data 1995-2021 
In this graphic we restrict focus on only the nations with an above OECD-average and visually represent the size of the debt using size and color. The reasoning behind this is that following the line graph above can be difficult so this should help with intuiting the scale. We use a smaller dataset to avoid being too messy and illegible.

# Discussion
There are pros and cons of each visualization technique used above. The first one, the bar chart, is very strong for conveying the single year's data as it is very simple to read and requires no explanation. The downside of it is that it is limited in scope to a single year as adding any more year data would exponentially make it harder to read. That volume of data is where the second method with the chart of bar graphs is useful as it conveys an incredible amount of data relatively succinctly. The issue is that it is hard to parse unless you have a specific country you care about and comparing between countries is nearly impossible. That's where the strength of the third graphic comes in, it is able to provide a strong middle ground by providing a reasonably large amount of data that is intuitive to parse and allows a decent comparison between countries, but with a mix of the downsides of both weaker readability \(compared to the bar graph\) and less information \(compared to the line graphs\) . Overall they all have strengths and weaknesses which can be used to fit a specific design need.
